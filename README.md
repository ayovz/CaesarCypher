# Caesar Cipher Program

This is a simple Caesar Cipher program written in Python. It allows you to encrypt or decrypt messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet.

## How It Works

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest forms of encryption. It works by shifting each letter in a message by a certain number of places in the alphabet.

For example:
- With a shift of 3, **A** becomes **D**, **B** becomes **E**, and so on.

## Features

- **Encode**: Encrypt a message.
- **Decode**: Decrypt a message.
- **Exit**: Quit the program.

## How to Use

1. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python caesarcypher.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompts:

- Type `encode` to encrypt a message.
- Type `decode` to decrypt a message.
- Type `exit` to close the program.

3. Enter your message and shift number when asked.

## Example
```bash
Type 'encode' to Encrypt, 'decode' to Decrypt, 'exit' to Exit:
> encode

Enter your message:
> hello

Enter shift number:
> 3

Encrypted message: khoor
```
